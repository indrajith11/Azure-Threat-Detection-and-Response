# azure-soc-honeynet
This project sets up a mini honeynet in Azure to monitor and analyze security threats. Logs are ingested into a Log Analytics Workspace and analyzed using Microsoft Sentinel. Metrics were measured in an insecure environment for 24 hours, then again for 24 hours after applying security controls, showing a significant reduction in security events.
